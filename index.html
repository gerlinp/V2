                        Hello! My name is Gerlin and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. I'm a self taught developer, who switched from a career in IT, and for as long as I can remember I've always had an interest in tech — While always having to assist clients in fixing and guiding them with programs got me more interested in buidling them to make better experiences. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward to today I've had the privelege of working for a <a href="https://www.salsify.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital management platform</a> as a software engineer CO-OP — Was selected for a <a href="https://www.hackdiversity.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fellowship</a> that gave me the tools and resources to make me a better developer while also helping to bridge the gap between the technology industry and underrepresented individuals. And contributed to <a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/maple" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">civic tech groups</a> to be able help, and improve the way goverment and community organizations serve the public by using technology.
